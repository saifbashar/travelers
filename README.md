### Live Site:

Live site link: [Travelers](https://travelers-saifbashar.web.app/)

### Reflection

- I create this website by using popular javascript framework react, react-router, react bootstrap components, mongodb for backend and firebase for authentication .
- In this website you can book your tour plan.
- For booking the tour plan you must login.
- You can also get your previously tour planning information but to get this you must login
- Login system are O'Auth login where you directly login by using google.
- From this website, Admin can see all booking information and confirm the pending the order.
